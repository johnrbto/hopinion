yo soy calena y este hotel sobre paso mis expectitivas. por eso el precio. los trabajadores fueron muy cordiales. hablan ingles. el desayuno estaba incluido. if you are looking for a nice and secure place to stay you had made the right choice. the personal is very cordial and helpful. the breakfast was included, everything fresh with an exelent presentation.the bedroom was clean with a nice view. it feels like you are at home, but you are actually at a very prestigius hotel.
