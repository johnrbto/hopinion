This is a wonderful place to stay. Most visitors to Azores choose the capital (Ponta Delgada) as their home base, but I would suggest the option of staying here for a few days.  - Location: 1,30 h from Ponta Delgada, 5 minutes drive from Furnas village, next to the Furnas lake, inside of a small volcano crater.  - Good location for visiting: Furnas, Nordeste (the North-East area of the island, with wonderful landscapes), beaches in Vilafranca do Campo, and the Lagoa do Fogo. It is also a wonderful location for resting.  - Description: 8 wooden cottages and 1 pool in the middle of a natural area. Cottages look like boxes of matches and are resting on pillars. Below there is a small water canal with fishes. Cottages are very stylish and perfectly equipped with air-conditioning, fireplace, TV, kitchenette, living-room , bedroom, and bathroom. Cottages are cleaned every 2 days.  - Service &amp; price: the price is not very cheap (especially for 1 night), but there are lower prices for 2 or more nights and 7 or more nights. The owners are Portuguese. Their deal with customers is correct but discreet. This is a location where customers are very independent.  - Cons: maybe the only con is the fact that there is no washing machine available for customers. Every cottage has a clotheshorse but customers have to wash by hand.  In sum, go there if you like nature, peace and being on your own. It is a good place for couples, groups of friends and families with small children. And it is a good home base for visiting the Eastern part of the island.
